This is a collection of Magic: The Gathering artwork, as published by Wizards
of the Coast. It makes for a great slideshow :)

All content is copyright Wizards of the Coast and is collected here for
convenience only. Most of these were published as Wallpaper of the Week, in
Magic Arcana or the Daily Activity - see the archive at
http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/downloads.aspx?x=mtg/daily/downloads/wallpapers
Others were posted to Magic Online as desktop backgrounds - see Places to Look
which enumerates the paths in which they're stored. A few are low-resolution
images from articles on dailymtg.com (including a few funny variants - see the
Extras subdirectory).

The very first image in the collection was Naya Hushblade, from MTGO background.
At the same time as it was used as the login screen (I think), Ardent Plea was
used as the main background; and I have great regrets at having not saved it.
If anyone has a copy, I'd love to get hold of it, because it's great art!
